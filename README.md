# Entangled
## Creative design by [ore.codes](https://ore.codes)

A multi-window browser visualization that simulates quantum entanglement between particle orbs across separate browser windows. Each orb features a dense nucleus with sparse outer atmosphere, connected by flowing particle streams that create the illusion of transparency when windows overlap.

Features

1. **Multi-window entanglement**: Orbs communicate across browser windows in real-time
2. **Discrete color mixing**: Nucleus particles blend colors from all connected orbs while maintaining surface identity
3. **Window transparency effect**: Overlapping windows reveal underlying orb content as if transparent
4. **Dynamic detanglement**: Minimized or closed windows automatically disconnect from the quantum network
5. **Performance optimized**: Efficient particle rendering with 5,000 orb particles and 2,000+ stream particles per connection

Built with Three.js and BroadcastChannel API for inter-window communication.
